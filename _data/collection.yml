poems:
  - title: "Still I Rise"
    author: "Maya Angelou"
    content: |
      You may write me down in history
      With your bitter, twisted lies,
      You may trod me in the very dirt
      But still, like dust, I'll rise.
      
      Does my sassiness upset you?
      Why are you beset with gloom?
      'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
      Pumping in my living room.

    author: "Robert Frost"
    content: |
      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
      And sorry I could not travel both
      And be one traveler, long I stood
      And looked down one as far as I could
      To where it bent in the undergrowth;
