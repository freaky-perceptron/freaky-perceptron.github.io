    Hello! I'm Bhavesh. I am part of 0 to 1 journey at <u><a href="https://getcrux.ai" style="color: #007bff;">Crux</a></u>, where I am spearheading the AI research and development efforts.

    <p>I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2023. Before joining crux I was placed at Deutsche Bank as software engineer where I developed in-house LLM solutions for Investment Banking technology. Previously worked at Sony Research, MyGlamm, and other startups building and training ML models :)</p>
    <p>I am enthusiastic about Tech, Philosphy, fitness and books! </p>
    <p>Outside of work, I cherish long runs that clear my mind and allow me to explore the limits of endurance and thought. Here on this blog, I share insights gathered along my journey - from philosophical musings to the latest in AI, and everything in between.</p>
