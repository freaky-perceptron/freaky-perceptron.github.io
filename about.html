    <p>Hi, I am Bhavesh. I like to understand and build things. I am curious about almost anything and everything. I grew up i
    <p>Currently I am working on AI Engineering aspects at TailoredAI where I get to build multiple AI products end-to-end, talk to customers, understand their problems and build solutions. Previously I was part of 0 to 1 journey at <u><a href="https://getcrux.ai" style="text-decoration: none; color: blueviolet;">Crux</a></u>. where I spearhead the Generative AI Research & Development efforts.</p>
    <p>I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2023. Before joining crux I was placed at Deutsche Bank as software engineer where I developed in-house LLM solutions for Investment Banking technology. Previously worked at Sony Research, MyGlamm, and other startups building and training ML models :)</p>
    <p>I am enthusiastic about Tech, Philosphy, Fitness and books! </p>
    <p>Outside of work, I cherish long runs that clear my mind and allow me to explore the limits of endurance and thought. Here on this blog, I share insights gathered along my journey - from philosophical musings to the latest in AI, and everything in between.</p>
